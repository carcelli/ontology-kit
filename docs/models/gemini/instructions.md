# Gemini Agent System: Ontology-Driven Architecture

This document outlines the approach for building an ontology-driven agent system using Gemini.

## Core Principles

*   **Ontology First:** The system's knowledge and capabilities are defined by a set of ontologies.
*   **Dynamic Agent Composition:** Agents are composed dynamically based on the available ontologies.
*   **Collaborative Ontology Building:** Agents will work together to extend and refine the ontologies over time.

## Architecture

*   **Ontology Store:** A central repository for storing and managing ontologies.
*   **Agent Kernel:** The core component responsible for agent lifecycle management and communication.
*   **Tooling:** A set of tools for creating, editing, and visualizing ontologies.

## Development Roadmap

1.  **Define Core Ontology:** Establish the foundational concepts and relationships for the system.
2.  **Implement Agent Kernel:** Build the basic infrastructure for agent creation and communication.
3.  **Develop Ontology Tools:** Create the necessary tools for working with ontologies.
4.  **Implement Collaborative Ontology Building:** Enable agents to modify and extend the ontologies.
5.  **Develop Application-Specific Agents:** Create agents for specific tasks and domains.
